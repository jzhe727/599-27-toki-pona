why of course the people dont want war why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country
